# JavaScript30 - 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge

![](https://javascript30.com/images/JS3-social-share.png)

Hello! I stumbled upon this free course by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) while scouring through different courses online. You may check this course out [here](https://javascript30.com/).

I know this says it's a 30 day challenge, but let's face it. I may or may not be able to finish this within 30 days.

Thanks!
